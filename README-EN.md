## Hi there 👋

Hello. My name is SOIV and I'm a videographer, working full-time.

I personally plan projects based on ideas and thoughts that come to mind, and I personally work on projects where possible. However, <br>
I don't know how to code and rely solely on AI for coding. <br>
My main job is editing and working on various videos on YouTube!

---
If you want to make the contents of the idea box into an actual project, please contact me by email.<br>
I'm willing to participate in the project.

If you want to participate in the project I'm working on, please contact me by email.
