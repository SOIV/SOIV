## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
[KR](README.md) / [JP](README-JP.md) / EN(translate : Google)

Hello. My name is SOIV and I am currently working as a videographer.

I don't know how to code, and I only use AI to code and do my own planning and work.<br>
My main job is editing and working on various videos on YouTube. I'm SOIV!
